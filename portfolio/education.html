                <p>My parents didn't have many opportunities to study. They were born in poverty and had to start to work so early in life even being children. Most of the formal education they received was when they were adults, but they didn't conclude the high school.</p>
                <p>I was more blessed than them. Even living in modest conditions, I had a chance to study since the early days of my life. My first years of education were in a public school near my house. I liked to study and sought to do my best and achieve good grades.</p>
                <p>I started to work when I was a teenager and had to manage my time to continue having good grades in school. This time I also started an English course that I used to attend on Saturdays. This was a tough period in my life. I had a busy schedule and few opportunities of leisure.</p>
                <p>After high school, I went on a two years mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. This voluntary service helped me develop study techniques and be a good learner.</p>

                <p>Being home after my mission, I went to University of Sao Paulo and after almost five years and hard work I received a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems.</p>
                <p>In the past few years I also received a post degree in Data Analytics Big Data.</p>
                <p>Now I am pursing a degree in BYU Idaho in Software Development. I think this helps me to practice my English and keep me up to date in my area of study. I also like the BYU learning method.</p>
                <p>This was as I achieved more of my formal education. I had other opportunities of study in other courses at work and Church. In my opinion a lifelong learning helps us to keep our minds alive, more we study, more became easier to learn new things.</p>

                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>When I was thinking about beginning a portfolio the first idea I had in mind was that a portfolio would be more like a professional resume. The problem is that I think my professional career it is not a straight path I have made some turns along the way even after receiving a bachelor’s degree in Information Systems and have been working more on projects related to information technology area.</p>
                <p>I thought I had no enough information to create a website about my professional portfolio and this assignment to write 600 words about it made me worried. So, I started a web search to learn more about professional portfolios and figure out what I should add to my portfolio to enrich it with relevant content.</p>
                <p>A article found in Havard Business Review site, titled <a href=https://hbr.org/2021/10/why-you-should-build-a-career-portfolio-not-a-career-path target="_blank">“Why You Should Build a ‘Career Portfolio’ (Not a ‘Career Path’)” </a> by April Rinne really opened my mind. In this article she says that a portfolio is a tool that represents the diversity of our professional journey with the routes change along the way. We determine what will be in our portfolio, it includes our formal academic education and paid jobs but it is not limited to these. I understood we should add more about our unique experiences that we had serving in family, friends, volunteer work, sports and even hobbies that helped us develop abilities that make us better professionals.</p>
                <p>With this new perspective, now I think I have much more content to start my portfolio. I also want to make it an example for those who wants to know more about a portfolio.</p>

                <h2>Organization</h2>
                <p>To start I will divide the content in three parts. The first is the “Home Page” where I will add information about my motivation to start a portfolio of my professional journey, a brief presentation of myself and a summary of the website. In the second part, “Work Experiences” page, I will describe my work paid and volunteer experiences. In the third part I will add my education experiences, the courses I have made, the groups I participated. I intend to name this page “Education”.</p>

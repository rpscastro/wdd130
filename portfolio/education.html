                <p>My first years of education were in public schools near my house. I liked to study and sought to do my best and achieve good grades.</p>
                <p>I started to work as a teenager and had to manage my time to continue having good grades in school. This time I also started an English course.</p>
                <p>After high school, I went on a two years mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. This voluntary service helped me develop study techniques and be a good learner.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Being home after my mission, I went to University of Sao Paulo and after almost five years and hard work I received a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Systems.</p>
                <p>I also received a post degree in Data Analytics Big Data.</p> 
                <p>Now I am pursing a degree in BYU Idaho in Software Development. I think this helps me to practice my English and keep me up to date in my area of study. I also like the BYU learning method.</p>

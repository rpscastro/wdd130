      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>When I was thinking about beginning a portfolio the first idea I had in mind was that a portfolio would be more like a professional resume. The problem is that I think my professional career it is not a straight path I have made some turns along the way even after receiving a bachelor’s degree in Information Systems and have been working more on projects related to information technology area.</p>
      <p>I thought I had no enough information to create a website about my professional portfolio and this assignment to write 600 words about it made me worried. So, I started a web search to learn more about professional portfolios and figure out what I should add to my portfolio to enrich it with relevant content.</p>
      <p>A article found in Havard Business Review site, titled <a href=https://hbr.org/2021/10/why-you-should-build-a-career-portfolio-not-a-career-path target="_blank">“Why You Should Build a ‘Career Portfolio’ (Not a ‘Career Path’)” </a> by April Rinne really opened my mind. In this article she says that a portfolio is a tool that represents the diversity of our professional journey with the routes change along the way. We determine what will be in our portfolio, it includes our formal academic education and paid jobs but it is not limited to these. I understood we should add more about our unique experiences that we had serving in family, friends, volunteer work, sports and even hobbies that helped us develop abilities that make us better professionals.</p>
      <p>With this new perspective, now I think I have much more content to start my portfolio. I also want to make it an example for those who wants to know more about a portfolio.</p>
      <p>Organization</p>
      <p>To start I will divide the content in three parts. The first is the “Home Page” where I will add information about my motivation to start a portfolio of my professional journey, a brief presentation of myself and a summary of the website. In the second part, “Work Experiences” page, I will describe my work paid and volunteer experiences. In the third part I will add my education experiences, the courses I have made, the groups I participated. I intend to name this page “Education”.</p>

      <h3>Work Experiences</h3>
      <p>Since my childhood I loved seen people working. I remember seeing men working building houses. It was a common activity in the new neighborhood where I was born in the outskirts of the Sao Paulo. It was an opportunity for children receiving money for helping in the transportation of building materials like bricks and sand.</p>
      <p> I thought me the value of money and the honest ways to earn it. I also used to earn money that time selling savory snacks door-to-door for neighbors and buying things for them in the market. Maybe it is not common activities for children today, but they were in 1980 decade in Brazil.</p>
      <p>My first paid job was an internship when I was almost 16. I was an office-boy. Some of my tasks were: deliver documents, go to banks to pay bills, deliver mail to Post Office and organize files. This experience helped me to look outside the few opportunities were presented in my neighborhood. Good people advised me for education opportunities and I started to study English course paid by myself.</p>
      <p>That time I also was baptized in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and decided to serve as full time missionary. This decision made me to leave that internship and prepare to serve voluntarily. Before serving as missionary, I worked temporally as salesperson in a baby items store and as office boy in another company.</p>
      <p>I was to called to serve in Brazil Belem Mission. This service made me grow in many different areas and helped me to develop an attention to the importance of human relationships. I learned to plan to achieve goals, teach, study techniques, plan presentations, plans travels, lead teams, work in teams, speak in public, companionship and much more.</p>
      <p>After my mission I worked some months as a call center operator and as a bilingual instructor in Missionary Training Center in Brazil. There I had the opportunity to develop my English and teaching skills.</p>
      <p>I started my bachelor’s degree in Information Systems while I was working at Missionary Training Center and soon as I left the work as instructor, I started some internships in two multinational companies in Information Technology consulting area.</p>
      <p>When I finished my bachelor’s degree. I continued to work in consulting companies as analyst and also got married that time and decided to change to have a fix local to work. I started to work in Banco do Brasil as a call center operator.</p>
      <p>I am working in Banco do Brasil for 9 years and my previous background helped me to have some professional promotions. Currently I started to work in IT department of the company.</p>

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>My first years of education were in public schools near my house. I liked to study and sought to do my best and achieve good grades.</p>
      <p>I started to work as a teenager and had to manage my time to continue having good grades in school. This time I also started an English course.</p>
      <p>After high school, I went on a two years mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. This voluntary service helped me develop study techniques and be a good learner.</p>
      <p>Being home after my mission, I went to University of Sao Paulo and after almost five years and hard work I received a Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems.</p>
      <p>I also received a post degree in Data Analytics Big Data.</p> 
      <p>Now I am pursing a degree in BYU Idaho in Software Development. I think this helps me to practice my English and keep me up to date in my area of study. I also like the BYU learning method.</p>

                <p>Since my childhood I loved seen people working. I remember seeing men working building houses. It was a common activity in the new neighborhood where I was born in the outskirts of the Sao Paulo. It was an opportunity for children receiving money for helping in the transportation of building materials like bricks and sand.</p>
                <p> I thought me the value of money and the honest ways to earn it. I also used to earn money that time selling savory snacks door-to-door for neighbors and buying things for them in the market. Maybe it is not common activities for children today, but they were in 1980 decade in Brazil.</p>
                <p>My first paid job was an internship when I was almost 16. I was an office-boy. Some of my tasks were: deliver documents, go to banks to pay bills, deliver mail to Post Office and organize files. This experience helped me to look outside the few opportunities were presented in my neighborhood. Good people advised me for education opportunities and I started to study English course paid by myself.</p>
                <p>That time I also was baptized in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and decided to serve as full time missionary. This decision made me to leave that internship and prepare to serve voluntarily. Before serving as missionary, I worked temporally as salesperson in a baby items store and as office boy in another company.</p>
                <p>I was to called to serve in Brazil Belem Mission. This service made me grow in many different areas and helped me to develop an attention to the importance of human relationships. I learned to plan to achieve goals, teach, study techniques, plan presentations, plans travels, lead teams, work in teams, speak in public, companionship and much more.</p>

                <p>After my mission I worked some months as a call center operator and as a bilingual instructor in Missionary Training Center in Brazil. There I had the opportunity to develop my English and teaching skills.</p>
                <p>I started my bachelor’s degree in Information Systems while I was working at Missionary Training Center and soon as I left the work as instructor, I started some internships in two multinational companies in Information Technology consulting area.</p>

                <p>When I finished my bachelor’s degree. I continued to work in consulting companies as analyst and also got married that time and decided to change to have a fix local to work. I started to work in Banco do Brasil as a call center operator.</p>
                <p>I am working in Banco do Brasil for 9 years and my previous background helped me to have some professional promotions. Currently I started to work in IT department of the company.</p>
